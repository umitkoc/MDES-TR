  description: "The Mastercard Digital Enablement API encompasses a set of APIs that\
    \ are initiated by the Token Requestor for the purposes of creating and managing\
    \ the life cycle of a token.     \n**Authentication**\n <br><br>\n Mastercard\
    \ uses OAuth 1.0a with body hash extension for authenticating the API clients.\
    \ This requires every request that you send to  Mastercard to be signed with an\
    \ RSA private key. A private-public RSA key pair must be generated consisting\
    \ of:\n <br><br>\n 1. A private key for the OAuth signature for API requests.\
    \ It is recommended to keep the private key in a password-protected or hardware\
    \ keystore.\n <br>\n 2. A public key is shared with Mastercard during the project\
    \ setup process through either a certificate signing request (CSR) or the API\
    \ Key Generator. Mastercard will use the public key to verify the OAuth signature\
    \ that is provided on every API call.<br>\n\n An OAUTH1.0a signer library is available\
    \ on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mastercard/oauth1-signer-java)\n <br><br>\n **Encryption**\n\
    \ <br><br>\n All communications between Issuer web service and the Mastercard\
    \ gateway is encrypted using TLS.\n <br><br>\n **Additional Encryption of Sensitive\
    \ Data**\n <br><br>\n In addition to the OAuth authentication, when using MDES\
    \ Digital Enablement Service, any PCI sensitive and all account holder Personally\
    \ Identifiable Information (PII) data must be encrypted. This requirement applies\
    \ to the API fields containing encryptedData. Sensitive data is encrypted using\
    \ a symmetric session (one-time-use) key. The symmetric session key is then wrapped\
    \ with an RSA Public Key supplied by Mastercard during API setup phase (the Customer\
    \ Encryption Key). <br>\n\n Java Client Encryption Library available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mastercard/client-encryption-java)\n"

        Used to digitize a card to create a server-based Token. MDES will perform both card availability and eligibility checks to check that this specific card is eligible for digitization. As both availability and eligibility are combined, only a Tokenization Authorization message is sent to the issuer as part of this request to authorize the digitization. No Tokenization Eligibility message is sent. The digitization decision will be one of Approved or Declined.

      description: |
        This API is used to retrieve static Assets from MDES?s repository, such as - Card art, MasterCard brand logos, Issuers? logos, and Terms and Conditions. Every Asset in the repository is referenced using an Asset ID. Once an Asset has been assigned to an Asset ID, the contents of the Asset will not change. If contents do need to change (for example, Issuer has supplied new artwork for a product), they will be updated in the repository and be assigned a new Asset ID.  Different types of Assets are supported in the repository, such as images and text files; and for each type of Asset, multiple formats may be supported. For example, a single image Asset may be supported in various file formats; or variant sizes, allowing the Token Requestor to select the most appropriate format to use for a particular target device.
